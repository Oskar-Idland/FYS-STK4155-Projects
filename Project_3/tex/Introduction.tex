The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has significantly impacted various fields, with medical imaging and diagnostics being among the most benefited areas \cite{litjens2017survey}. A key development in this field is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model known for being effective in image recognition and classification. CNNs are widely used in healthcare, especially for important tasks like tumor detection and disease classification, where accuracy and efficiency are crucial \cite{9395920}. However, many traditional neural networks, including CNNs, need a lot of computational power, which can make them less suitable for use in resource-limited environments \cite{howard2017mobilenetsefficientconvolutionalneural}. 

To address this, more efficient architectures like MobileNet and ResNet have been created. MobileNet is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for tasks like medical image classification \cite{howard2017mobilenetsefficientconvolutionalneural}. ResNet, on the other hand, uses residual connections to help train deep networks, which solves the degradation problem and improves performance in complex image recognition tasks \cite{he2015deepresiduallearningimage}. Together, these architectures offer a range of solutions for efficient and effective deep learning in medical imaging applications.

This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of various neural network architectures on a breast cancer histopathological dataset, focusing on three specific models: a custom CNN, MobileNet, and ResNet101. These models are selected based on their differing complexities, training requirements, and computational efficiencies. In this analysis, we will compare how well these models handle a small and imbalanced dataset, aiming to understand how different architectures affect classification accuracy and performance in medical applications.

This report is organized as follows: First, we introduce the theoretical concepts behind neural networks, CNNs, MobileNet, and ResNet, along with the relevant evaluation metrics. Next, we discuss the methods and implementation, including data preprocessing and model architectures. We then present the results, comparing the performance of the models. Finally, we conclude by summarizing our findings and identifying the most suitable model for handling complex data.
