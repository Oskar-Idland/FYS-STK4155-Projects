  abstract = "Cancer is a condition in which abnormal cells uncontrollably split and damage the body tissues. Hence, detecting cancer at an early stage is highly essential. Currently, medical images play an indispensable role in detecting various cancers; however, manual interpretation of these images by radiologists is observer-dependent, time-consuming, and tedious. An automatic decision-making process is thus an essential need for cancer detection and diagnosis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on automated cancer detection in various human body organs, namely, the breast, lung, liver, prostate, brain, skin, and colon, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and medical imaging techniques. It also includes a brief discussion about deep learning based on state-of-the-art cancer detection methods, their outcomes, and the possible medical imaging data used. Eventually, the description of the dataset used for cancer detection, the limitations of the existing solutions, future trends, and challenges in this domain are discussed. The utmost goal of this paper is to provide a piece of comprehensive and insightful information to researchers who have a keen interest in developing CNN-based models for cancer detection."

  abstract = "With the continuous improvement of human living standards, dietary habits are constantly changing, which brings various bowel problems. Among them, the morbidity and mortality rates of colorectal cancer have maintained a significant upward trend. In recent years, the application of deep learning in the medical field has become increasingly spread aboard and deep. In a colonoscopy, Artificial Intelligence based on deep learning is mainly used to assist in the detection of colorectal polyps and the classification of colorectal lesions. But when it comes to classification, it can lead to confusion between polyps and other diseases. In order to accurately diagnose various diseases in the intestines and improve the classification accuracy of polyps, this work proposes a multiclassification method for medical colonoscopy images based on deep learning, which mainly classifies the four conditions of polyps, inflammation, tumor, and normal. In view of the relatively small number of data sets, the network firstly trained by transfer learning on ImageNet was used as the pretraining model, and the prior knowledge learned from the source domain learning task was applied to the classification task about intestinal illnesses. Then, we fine-tune the model to make it more suitable for the task of intestinal classification by our data sets. Finally, the model is applied to the multiclassification of medical colonoscopy images. Experimental results show that the method in this work can significantly improve the recognition rate of polyps while ensuring the classification accuracy of other categories, so as to assist the doctor in the diagnosis of surgical resection.",
